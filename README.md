# CS8803 DRL Project - Group 26

This repo contains modifications to the implementation of "Preparing for the Unknown: Learning a Universal Policy with Online System Identification." 
Due to the age of this project, we have prepared specialized installation instructions to ensure that all necessary dependency versions are compatible with one another. 

## Installation

Create a virtualenv with python 3.10. Use it for the rest of this install procedure.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
- If there is a cloudpickle issue, remove the lines correponding to `gym` in requirements.txt, and retry, then install gym separately.


Download mujoco.
- Follow instructions here: https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py


Fix dart includes.
- As root:
- `mkdir -p /usr/include/dart/utils/detail; cd /usr/include/dart/utils/detail`
- `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dartsim/dart/refs/heads/main/dart/utils/detail/XmlHelpers-impl.hpp`


Build packages.
- `cd baselines; pip install -e .; cd ../`
- `cd pydart2; pip install -e .; sed -i "s/from . //g" pydart2/pydart2_api.py; cd ../`
    - Somehow, SWIG autogenerated module file has broken imports
- `cd policy_transfer; pip install -e .`

All done! Try running examples as in `policy_transfer/README.md`.
