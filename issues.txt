pip install psutil scikit-learn cma mujoco_py patchelf

Edit pydart2/pydart2_api.py to fix import generated by SWIG

If using tensorflow 2.x: Replace all occurences of `import tensorflow as tf` with `import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf`
	and add into `baselines::baselines/common/tf_util.py`: `tf.disable_eager_execution()`

Also comment out lines in `baselines::baselines/common/tf_util.py::_Function.__init__` which are checking attrs of inputs.
